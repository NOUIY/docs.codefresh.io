When you use Codefresh for Continuous Integration, one of the most basic tasks is compiling and packaging applications. Even though Codefresh has native support for Docker artifacts, it still works great with traditional (non-dockerized) applications that don't use a Dockerfile for the actual build.

>If your application is deployed as a Docker image then see the [Building Docker images guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/ci-cd-guides/building-docker-images/) instead.

## Using supporting Docker images in a CI/CD environment

Unlike other CI solutions that you might be familiar with, Codefresh build nodes are very simple. They have only Docker installed and nothing else. When you run a Codefresh pipeline you choose the Docker images that will be used as a CI/CD environment. Once the pipeline runs, the Docker images are automatically launched by Codefresh and thus you have access to all the tools that they contain. Once the pipeline finishes, all Docker images that were used for the pipeline are discarded and the build machine reverts back to the original state.

So even if your application is not itself packaged as a Docker image, Codefresh pipelines are always "Docker-based" in the sense that Docker is used for the tools that take part in the pipeline.

This approach has a lot of advantages:

 * There is no maintenance effort for build nodes. They only have Docker and nothing else.
 * You can use any tool in your pipeline that you want without actually installing it first
 * All public Docker images in Docker Hub are potential pipeline steps
 * You can use different versions of the same tool in the same pipeline
 * It is very easy to upgrade a tool to a new version (just change the tag of the Docker container used)

Notice also that unlike some other CI solutions:

1. You can use multiple Docker images in the same pipeline (even if they contain the same tool) with no version conflicts
1. You can use *any* Docker image. Docker images used in Codefresh pipelines have no special requirements so any public or private Docker image can be used in your pipeline.

All [pipeline steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/) in Codefresh are in fact Docker images.


## Choosing programming tools as Docker images

In practice this means that if you have a Node application, you need to use a [Node image]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/learn-by-example/nodejs)  to package your application, a [Maven image]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/learn-by-example/java/spring-boot-2/) if you are working with Java, a [Python]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/learn-by-example/python/) image for python applications, and so on. You launch the image using the Codefresh freestyle step. Here is an example for Node:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  my_node_app:
    title: Running unit tests
    image: node:11
    commands:
     - npm install
     - npm run test
{% endhighlight %}

This pipeline will download the `node:11` image on the Codefresh build machine, launch it, and pass it your source code. Then it will run the commands `npm install` and `npm run test`. The result is that your source code can be packaged without actually installing Node.js on the build machine beforehand.

You can mix and max different images on the same pipeline. Let's say for example that you have a single repository that contains a front-end in Node.js and a back-end in Java. You can easily create a pipeline that deals with both:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  my_node_app:
    title: Packaging front end
    image: node:11
    working_directory: ./front-end
    commands:
     - npm install
     - npm run test
  my_jar_compilation:
    title: Packaging back end
    image: maven:3.5.2-jdk-8-alpine
    working_directory: ./back-end
    commands:
     - mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/codefresh/volume/m2_repository package   
{% endhighlight %}

This pipeline will compile the Java code under the `back-end` folder and the Javascript Web application found in the `front-end` folder. Note that both Docker images have access to the same workspace via [the automatic Codefresh volume]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/#sharing-the-workspace-between-build-steps).

Therefore if you want to use Codefresh as fast as possible you can simply search Dockerhub for an existing image that uses the tool that you need. Top- level DockerHub images are curated by the Docker team and are considered safe. So for most popular programming languages, there is already a Docker image that you can use in your pipeline.

Of course, you can also [create your private Docker image or use any existing image]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/docker-registries/working-with-docker-registries/) from a private or public Registry. In that case, you need to write the full name to the image used. For example, if you use an image from GCR or another private registry you mention it like this:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  my_bazel_app:
    title: Running a Bazel build
    image: gcr.io/my-registry/bazel
    commands:
     - bazel build //:MyProject
  my_e2e_tests:
    title: Running Mocha Test
    image: my-azure-registry.azurecr.io/kostis-codefresh/my-jasmine-runner:1.0.1 
    commands:
     - jasmine init
{% endhighlight %}

In this pipeline Docker images have a full prefix, so they are pulled by the respective registry instead of DockerHub.

In this manner, you can run any tool in any Codefresh pipeline as long as it is offered in a Docker image. This means that Codefresh pipelines can work with any programming language and any tool that you can use on your workstation.

Unlike other CI solutions, you don't need to wait for the Codefresh team to add "native support" for your favorite tool in a Codefresh pipeline. You can simply package it in a Docker image yourself and use it straight away.


## Using multiple Docker images in a single pipeline

Notice that unlike other CI solutions, there is no limit on the Docker images that you can use in a single pipeline. Also, all Docker images that take part in the same pipeline, have access to the same project workspace via the [shared Codefresh volume]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/#sharing-the-workspace-between-build-steps).

This means that you have maximum flexibility on what tools you use in a single project. As an example, let's see a pipeline that is using 4 different images for a single project.


`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    stage: prepare
    type: git-clone
    arguments:
      repo: my-user/my-app
      revision: master
      git: github
  package_my_code:
    title: Compile application
    image: 'maven:3.5.2-jdk-8-alpine'
    commands:
     - mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/codefresh/volume/m2_repository package   
  run_sonar:
    title: Quality Analysis
    image: sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli
    commands:
     - sonar-scanner
    environment:
     - SONAR_HOST_URL=http://foo.acme:9000     
  create_bucket:
    title: Creating bucket in AWS
    image: hashicorp/terraform:0.12.0
    commands:
      - terraform init
      - terraform apply -auto-approve   
  upload_file:
    title: Uploading Jar file
    image: mesosphere/aws-cli
    commands:
     - aws s3 sync ./target/app.jar s3://my-bucket/my-jar --delete        
{% endhighlight %}

This pipeline is doing the following:

1. Checking out source code
1. Packaging a Jar file (from the source code)
1. Running Sonar analysis (taking into account both source code and compiled classes)
1. Creating a storage bucket in AWS
1. Uploading the JAR that was packaged in the bucket.

Notice how all Docker images use the same workspace without any extra configuration on your part.

## Using different tool versions in the same pipeline 

The corollary to Docker-based pipelines is that you can use the same tool but with a different version in the **same** pipeline.
As an example here is a pipeline that runs both Python 2.x and Python 3.x in the same pipeline and it just works.

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  get_deps:
    title: Getting dependencies
    image: python:3.6-slim
    commands:
     - pip install -r requirements.txt
  run_my_tests:
    title: Running Unit Test
    image: python:2 
    commands:
     - pip install pytest
     - pytest
{% endhighlight %}

This means that you can easily choose the specific version that matches each of your projects. Here is another example
where two different applications use Node.js 11 and Node.js 9 in the same pipeline.

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
 - packaging
 - deploying
steps:
  PackageMyNode1App:
    title: Packaging Node application 1
    stage: packaging
    image: node:11.1
    working_directory: ./brand-new-project
    commands:
      - echo "My Node version is"
      - node --version
      - npm install
  PackageMyNode2App:
    title: Packaging Node application 2
    stage: packaging
    image: node:9.3.0-slim
    working_directory: ./legacy-project
    commands:
      - echo "My Node version is"
      - node --version
      - npm install  
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that these versions are per pipeline. So you can have each team using the versions they like for their projects
without affecting each other.

So one team in your company might use terraform 0.10 in their pipelines


{% highlight yaml %}
  PlanWithTerraform:
    image: hashicorp/terraform:0.10.0
    title: Deploying Terraform plan
    stage: deploy
    commands:
      - terraform plan
{% endhighlight %}

...while another team is using terraform 0.12 just by changing the YAML of their codefresh.yml

{% highlight yaml %}
  DeployWithTerraform:
    image: hashicorp/terraform:0.12.0
    title: Deploying Terraform plan
    stage: deploy
    commands:
      - terraform apply -auto-approve 
{% endhighlight %}


In summary, it is very easy to use any version of any programming tool in a Codefresh pipeline without the fear of breaking 
another unrelated pipeline.
