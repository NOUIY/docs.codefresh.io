In this tutorial we will see how Codefresh can be used by many developers who work on multiple features and how to create separate demo environments for each feature. 

Codefresh has the unique capability of launching Docker images in temporary test environments. These test environments
are ephemeral and are not intended to be used as QA (let alone production) environments. They are perfect
for quick demos. Use them
if you want to quickly share a feature with a colleague or a customer.

## Launching a Docker image using Codefresh

Docker images play a central role in Codefresh. The [basic CI tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/getting-started/create-a-basic-pipeline/) describes how you can easily create a Docker image from your source code.

In this section we will take this one step further and actually launch the result Docker image.
Codefresh has the unique capability of launching a docker image (using [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) behind the scenes) on the same hosted environment that Codefresh itself runs.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/demo-stage.jpg" 
url="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/demo-stage.jpg" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

This means that with zero effort from your side you can quickly inspect the status of your application using the Codefresh infrastructure. 






To start a Docker image as a demo environment, locate it in the *Images* section and click the *launch* button.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/launch.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/launch.png" 
alt="Launching a Docker image" 
caption="Launching a Docker image (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="80%" 
%}


Our sample application is self-contained (it consists of only a single Docker image) so choose *standalone* for the popup menu. Codefresh can also launch demo environments for applications that consist of multiple images (e.g. a service image and a database image). This capability happens with Codefresh *compositions* which are described in detail in section [On-Demand Environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/on-demand-test-environment/create-composition/).

Codefresh automatically knows which port should be exposed in the test environment
(i.e. which port of the Docker container should be made available for external connections). The sample application we are using here is exposing its web interface at port 5000 (but a random port will actually be assigned for external connections).

Once your application is launched, Codefresh will present the run log. You will see the same messages that would appear if you executed the `docker run` command locally. 

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/launch-url.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/launch-url.png" 
alt="Start logs" 
caption="Start logs (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="60%" 
%}

## Accessing the test environment

Once launch is complete, Codefresh will print a dynamic URL that contains the deployed environment. Now you have a demo environment created just for you! You can send this link with an email to a colleague to ask for feedback or to a customer to show progress.



{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/demo-environment.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/demo-environment.png" 
alt="Demo environment" 
caption="Demo environment (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="60%" 
%}


The number of concurrent test environments that you can have depends on your Codefresh account. Remember that you should never treat
these on demand environments as production ones. They were never designed that way.

If the environment is not functioning correctly for your own application, make sure that the port exposed by Codefresh in the *Launch settings* is the one that is actually used in your application as an HTTP endpoint. 

To find your existing on-demand environments, click *Compositions* `->` *Running Compositions* on the left part of the screen. You will get a list of your active environments. You can see details such as:

* Which branch is this environment from
* Which Git commit represents this environment
* What is the URL endpoint created by Codefresh

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/env-details.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/quick-start-test-pr/env-details.png" 
alt="Details for an environment" 
caption="Details for an environment (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="70%" 
%}

On the right side, you can find a list of buttons that allow you to visit the environment directly, share the link on Slack and most importantly stop the environment, so that it doesn't count against your account. It is a good practice to launch environments only when you need them and clean them up once you are done with them.
