Codefresh supports syncing between the teams created in Codefresh and your Identity Provider (IdP).
Team sync enables all users 

You can sync teams:
* Automatically, in the Codefresh UI when you set up the SSO for the IdP
* Manually, through the [synchronize teams command](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/teams/synchronize-teams/) via the [Codefresh CLI](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/) 

> Team sync is supported for OIDC providers. For SAML, team-sync is supported only for Google.


Example: 

To sync your Azure teams, run: 


```shell
codefresh synchronize teams <my-client-name> -t azure
```
where:  
`<my-client-name>` is the Client Name/Assertion URL/Callback URL that is automatically generated by Codefresh when you save the SSO configuration for your provider.

%}


Even though you can run this command manually it makes more sense to run it periodically as a job. And the obvious
way to perform this, is with a Codefresh CI pipeline. The CLI can be used as a [freestyle step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/freestyle/).

You can create a git repository with a [codefresh.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/) file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '1.0'
steps:
  syncMyTeams:
    title: syncTeams
    image: codefresh/cli
    commands:
      - 'codefresh synchronize teams my-client-name -t azure'
```

To fully automate this pipeline you should set a [cron trigger]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/triggers/cron-triggers/) for it. The cron-trigger will run this pipeline (and therefore synchronize the teams) in a fully automated manner.

This way you can synchronize your teams every day/week/hour depending on you Cron trigger setup.

## CLI synchronize teams command

If the `Restrict inviting additional users by email address domain` is enabled for your account, running the `synchronize teams` command via the CLI, does not invite new users to Codefresh. The output of the command will look similar to the following:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "update",
    "teams": [
      {
        "team": "developers",
        "members": [
          {
            "members": [],
            "action": "create"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "team": "DevOps",
        "members": [
          {
            "members": [],
            "action": "create"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The cause of this is the 

1. Navigate to Account Settings > User & Teams > Security
1. Toggle off "Restrict inviting additional users by email address domain."
1. Save.
1. Rerun the sync command.

## Sync GitHub Organization Teams to Codefresh

As an admin, you may want to sync your GitHub Organization Teams with your Codefresh account. At the same time, you do not want to set up an SSO provider and have the users use any login provider they choose.

The Personal Access Token (PAT) from a user will sync ALL Organizations and ALL Teams to which the user has access. It is recommended to use a "machine" account to access the one organization you need.

1. Create a PAT that has access to read organizations and teams
1. Install and configure the Codefresh CLI

    `codefresh synchronize teams github -t github --tk $GHTOKEN`

1. The sync will invite all users except for those that have private email settings turned on.

Once the initial sync happens, you can set up a cron trigger pipeline to run the command on a schedule.
